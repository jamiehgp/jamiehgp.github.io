    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Jamie Berger is the Senior Innovation Educator at
      <span style="color: black"> The Hidden Genius Project, Detroit </span>. As
      an Ann Arbor native with family roots in Detroit, Jamie has returned to
      Michigan to fulfill her mission of improving the pipeline of young, Black
      people into the field of technology innovation. While completing her
      Masters in Computer Science at Michigan Technological University, Jamie
      felt the direct impact of the lack of diversity. To change that impact,
      Jamie moved to Washington D.C. to teach computer science to high school
      students of color while simultaneously earning her Masters in Education
      from Johns Hopkins University. Throughout her educational process, Jamie
      constructed a passion for creating culturally responsive educational
      content that emphasizes learners' interests to keep them engaged and
      motivated. Jamie hopes to continue inspiring Black youth to have a seat at
      the table in future technology innovations that may impact the globe.

      In her freetime, Jamie enjoys getting tattoos, watching TV (Naruto,
      reality TV, crime dramas), going to the skatepark, and playing with her
      new baby girl!
